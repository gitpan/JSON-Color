NAME
    JSON::Color - Encode to colored JSON

VERSION
    version 0.04

SYNOPSIS
     use JSON::Color qw(encode_json);
     say encode_json([1, "two", {three => 4}]);

DESCRIPTION
    This module generates JSON, colorized with ANSI escape sequences.

    To change the color, see the %theme in the source code. In theory you
    can also modify it to colorize using HTML.

FUNCTIONS
  encode_json($data, \%opts) => STR
    Encode to JSON. Will die on error (e.g. when encountering non-encodeable
    data like Regexp or file handle).

    Known options:

    *   pretty => BOOL (default: 0)

        Pretty-print.

    *   linum => BOOL (default: 0)

        Show line number.

FAQ
  What about loading?
    Use JSON.

SEE ALSO
    To colorize with HTML, you can try Syntax::Highlight::JSON.

    Syntax::SourceHighlight can also colorize JSON/JavaScript to HTML or
    ANSI escape. It requires the GNU Source-highlight library.
